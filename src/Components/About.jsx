        <p>I'm a passionate Software Developer with over five years of professional experience, specializing in ASP.NET MVC, SSRS, SQL, and TypeScript. I began my journey at Cognizant, where I contributed to impactful enterprise solutions, and later expanded my skills through freelancing and continuous learning.
         </p>
         <br/>
        <p>As life led me across countries and into new roles, I embraced every transition as a chance to growâ€”personally and professionally. I expanded my skill set with certifications in UiPath and MEAN Stack development, and explored modern frameworks like React and Next.js through freelance projects and advanced coursework.
        </p>
             <br/>
             <p>My enthusiasm for technology has only deepened over the years. Iâ€™m currently volunteering as a web developer on platforms like Catchafire and VolunteerMatch, contributing to nonprofit projects that make a real difference. These experiences have strengthened my communication, adaptability, and problem-solving skills, while keeping me hands-on with the latest tools and best practices. </p>
             <br/>
             <p>Alongside actively upskilling in React, Iâ€™m also refreshing and deepening my expertise in .NET technologies, including .NET Core and API development, to stay aligned with modern backend development standards. I love applying what I learn to build clean, efficient, and impactful web applications.</p>
             <br/>
             <p>Iâ€™m excited to connect with like-minded professionals and explore opportunities to collaborate, learn, and make a meaningful impact together. ðŸ˜Š</p>
